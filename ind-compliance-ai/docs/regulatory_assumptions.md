# Regulatory Assumptions

- Phase 1 is designed for China IND pre-submission support.
- Rule references are tied to explicit regulation versions.
- Missing data can be acceptable only under explicit exemption logic.
- Submission profile (FIH/Amendment/Supplement) determines active rule subsets.
- All outputs are support artifacts, not legal or regulatory determinations.
